# ADIS Lightning Talk

## How to build
1. Clone the repo (Note: you have to use `--recursive` to get the submodules, too)
2. Go to `./awesome-beamer/beamerthemeawesome.sty` and change line 54 from `]{smile}` to `]{smile/smile}`
3. Use your favourite LaTeX compiler (but be aware that you have to run it multiple times)
4. Enjoy the beautiful typesetting
