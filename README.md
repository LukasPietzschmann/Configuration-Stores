# Configuration stores

This repo contains the slides for a small presentation about highly available
distributed configuration stores.

## How to build
1. You need to clone using the `--recursive` switch
2. Just call `latexmk` on the `main.tex` file

If you don't want to build the slides yourself, you can also download them [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/Configuration-Stores/files/12793983/main.pdf).
